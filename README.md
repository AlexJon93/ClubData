# ClubData

My first attempt at writing a secure basic rest api in nodejs with a react frontend. Goal of the project 
is to develop a database of club members and eventually allow for automatic text messaging/emailing of members 
through the twilio api

Tasks to be completed:
--------------
* implement some kind of testing framework
* clean up the client side stuff
* work on auto text function with twilio
